This is a simulator to test the concept of and operation of data interoperbility between proprietary Internet of Things (IoT) Devices. 

For interoperbility is acheived with the following components:
  1. IoT Devices (Nest, Ecobee, etc)
  2. A Local IoT Hub
  3. Cloud Based Respository

The simulator is currenlty being developed as part of my BEng degree and as such this repository will include development code.
